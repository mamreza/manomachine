The Mano Assembler and Simulator</H1>

<H2>
1. Introduction / Motivation</H2>
It is a fact that, especially when dealing with computers, the best way
to learn is through trial and error.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it is difficult
to try and err when learning about a fictitious processor, such as the
one described in M. Mano's Computer System Architecture, 3rd ed.&nbsp;
It is in this interest that I have constructed an assembler and simulator
for students at R.I.T. and other universities.&nbsp; The assembler and
simulator are programmed in C++, and can be compiled on both Sun and Intel
platforms.
<H2>
2. The Mano Assembler</H2>
This is an assembler for the fictitious Mano Machine that assembles mano
source files (*.asm) into Mano Simulator module files (*.m).&nbsp; The
distribution package can be downloaded in both <A HREF="manoasm.tar">tar
format</A>, and <A HREF="manoasm.zip">zip format</A>.&nbsp; The same package
compiles under both Sun and Intel machines.&nbsp; The <A HREF="manoasm.html">reference
manual</A> is online, and included with the distribution.
<H2>
3. The Mano Simulator</H2>
A simulator for the fictitious Mano Machine that accepts Mano Simulator
module files (*.m), and provides step-by-step simulation down to the clock-tick
level.&nbsp; The simulator can also assemble code on the fly using the
same engine as the Mano Assembler, without the need for the Mano Assembler
package.&nbsp; The distribution package can be downloaded in both <A HREF="manosim.tar">tar
format</A>, and <A HREF="manosim.zip">zip format</A>.&nbsp; The same package
compiles under both Sun and Intel machines.&nbsp; The <A HREF="manosim.html">reference
manual</A> is online, and included with the distribution.
