MANOASM Reference Manual</H1>

<H2>
1. Introduction</H2>
This document describes the operation of <I>manoasm</I>, an assembler for
the fictitious Mano Machine that assembles mano source files (*.asm) into
Mano Simulator module files (*.m).&nbsp; For more information on the Mano
instruction set and assembly language syntax, please see M. Mano's Computer
System Architecture book, listed in the <A HREF="#References">references</A>
section.&nbsp; Mano Simulator module files are simply text files that contain
a list of instructions that are readable by the Mano Simulator (see accompanying
MANOSIM Reference manual for more details).
<H2>
2. Compilation</H2>
The Mano Assembler is written in C++, and is designed to be compile-able
under both the Sun and Windows 95 / NT systems.&nbsp; Because the source
relies on only standard C++ libraries, little or no modification may be
needed to port it to other platforms as well.&nbsp; If you are interested
in porting the assembler to another platform, please <A HREF="mailto:mlr5773@rit.edu">send
me mail</A>.
<H3>
2.1 On Sun Solaris Systems</H3>
The source will successfully compile on a Solaris system running SPARC
Compiler 4.2, and will work without modification for various other flavors
as well.&nbsp; Simply define the __SOLARIS preprocessor symbol.&nbsp; A
make file is provided that does this for you.&nbsp; To compile, therefore,
change to the ManoAssembler directory, and simply type:
<BR><TT>&nbsp;</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make</TT>

<P>Assuming your compiler is installed correctly, this should produce an
executable file called <TT>manoasm</TT>.&nbsp; See <A HREF="#Invocation">Invocation</A>
for details on how to execute the assembler.
<H3>
2.2 On Windows 95 / NT Systems</H3>
The source will successfully compile with Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0, and
will work without modification for various other flavors as well.&nbsp;
Instructions for building the executable are as follows:
<OL>
<LI>
Load Microsoft Developer Studio</LI>

<LI>
Click File, New.</LI>

<LI>
Select Win32 Console Application from the Projects tab.</LI>

<LI>
For the project name, type <TT>manoasm</TT>.</LI>

<LI>
For the location, browse to the ManoAssembler folder.</LI>

<LI>
Check the Win32 platform in the platforms box.</LI>

<LI>
Click OK to create the project files.</LI>

<LI>
Click Project, Add to Project, Files...</LI>

<LI>
Select all the .cpp and .h files in the folder, and click OK.</LI>

<LI>
Click Build, Set Active Configuration, and select the Release configuration.</LI>

<LI>
Finally, Click Build, Rebuild All to build the project.</LI>
</OL>
This should produce a folder called Release, containing the <TT>manoasm.exe</TT>
executable file.&nbsp; To execute it, open up a Command Prompt, change
directories, and run <TT>manoasm</TT>.&nbsp; See <A HREF="#Invocation">Invocation</A>
for details on how to execute the assembler.
<H2>
<A NAME="Invocation"></A>3. Invocation</H2>
The <TT>manoasm</TT> program has the following syntax:

<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; manoasm &lt;<I>infile</I>>
&lt;<I>outfile</I>></TT>

<P>where <I><TT>infile</TT></I> is the name of the assembly source file,
and <I><TT>outfile</TT></I> is the name of the Mano Simulator module file
to create.&nbsp; The Mano Simulator module file produced can also be used
as an assembly listing since it displays the addresses and source statements.&nbsp;
See <A HREF="#OutputFormat">Output Format</A> for more information about
this file.&nbsp; There are no other options associated with the assembler.
<H2>
<A NAME="OutputFormat"></A>4. Output Format</H2>
The Mano Assembler produces three sets of output: the error listing, the
symbol table, and the Mano Simulator Module file.
<H3>
4.1 The Error Listing</H3>
The error listing is sent to the standard output device after the banner
is displayed.&nbsp; See the <A HREF="#ErrorMessages">Error Messages</A>
section for details on the format and meaning of error messages.
<H3>
4.2 The Symbol Table</H3>
If there are no errors, a symbol table is produced, in the following format:

<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LLL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
0xaaa</TT>

<P>where <TT>LLL</TT> is the name of the label.&nbsp; As per Mano's specifications,
the label must be a maximum of 3 characters.&nbsp; The <TT>aaa</TT> represents
the address associated with the given symbol, in hexadecimal format.&nbsp;
Because there are only 4096 bytes of memory available, a 3 digit hex number
is sufficient.
<H3>
4.3 The Mano Simulator Module File</H3>
If there are no errors, a Mano Simulator Module file is created at the
specified path.&nbsp; The module file is simply a list of instructions
for the Mano Simulator to execute in order to ensure that the machine code
for the program given as input is placed in the correct area of memory
in the simulator.&nbsp; For your convenience, a comment is attached to
each line of the file stating the line of source that created it.&nbsp;
In this respect, the module file can also be used as a listing.&nbsp; Each
line of output is in the following format:

<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; aaaa&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
cccc&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; / ssssss</TT>

<P>where <TT>m</TT> is the physical character <TT>'m'</TT>, <TT>aaaa</TT>
is the address that the given statement is being assembled at, <TT>cccc</TT>
is the machine code representation of the statement, and <TT>ssssss</TT>
is the source code representation of the statement.
<H2>
<A NAME="ErrorMessages"></A>5. Error Messages</H2>
If there is an error in the source file, the Mano Assembler will list the
errors that it found, and stop the assembly process.&nbsp; The errors that
it lists have the following format:

<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ffff(n) : tttt ooeeee:
mmmmmm</TT>

<P>where <TT>ffff</TT> is the name of the source file producing the error,
<TT>n</TT> is the line of code that produced the error, <TT>tttt</TT> is
the type of error, and can either be <TT>error</TT> (compilation cannot
continue), or <TT>warning</TT> (compilation can continue), <TT>oo</TT>
is the internal source of error, and can either be <TT>A</TT> (assembler
error / warning) or <TT>SL</TT> (I/O error).&nbsp; The <TT>eeee</TT> represents
the error number, used to identify the error.&nbsp; For assembler errors,
the first digit of this number indicates the severity of the error (0 =
Fatal Error, 1 = Parsing Error, 2 = Assembly Error, 3 = Warning).&nbsp;
Finally, <TT>mmmmmm</TT> is a message describing the error.&nbsp; The following
is a comprehensive table of all the different possible errors:
